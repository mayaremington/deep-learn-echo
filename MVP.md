The goal of this project is to apply a deep learning model to echocardiogram images in order to classify the images by their timing in the cardiac cycle: end-diastole (max relaxation), end-systole (max contraction), or neither. So far, I have isolated images representing end-diastole and end-systole from video-clips, and have generated a simple CNN model to distinguish between them. After 30 epochs trained on a subset of the data (1450 data points), this model has an accuracy score of 0.64.

Next, I plan to return to the video clips to isolate images representing neither end-diastole nor  end-systole (i.e. my third class). I then plan to train my model on all of my training data (85% of 40,000 data points, leaving 12.5% for validation and 12.5% for test). Next, I’ll try a transfer learning CNN. Then I’ll adjust the hyperparameters of whatever model is performing best.
